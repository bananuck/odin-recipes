        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chewy and soft on the inside and lighty pan-fried crispy on the outside, then slathered in
            a sweet and savoury sauce. This potato mochi is like hashbrown's distant 2nd cousin, twice
            removed.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Potato Mochi</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>300 g of any starchy potato like Russet or Yukon Gold</li>
            <li>30 g of potato starch</li>
            <li>30 g of milk</li>
            <li>15 g of butter</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed for wrapping</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>35 g of soy sauce</li>
            <li>25 g of white sugar</li>
            <li>20 g of mirin</li>
            <li>20 g of sake (or use mirin, but it will be slightly sweeter)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the potatoes until fork tender and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cut the nori seaweed into small rectangles to wrap the mochi.</li>
            <li>Once the potato is cool, add potato starch and milk bit by bit while kneading it together.
                Adjust the amount to add based on how wet the dough is. You should be able to form the 
                dough into little patties but they shouldn't be too wet or sticky.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into round patties.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pan fry the potato mochi patties until golden on each side.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce into the pan and cook until it thickens.</li>
            <li>Cover the potato mochi with the sauce and wrap with the prepared nori seaweed.</li>
        </ol>
