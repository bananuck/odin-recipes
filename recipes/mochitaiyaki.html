        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A chewier spin on the classic Japanese favourite! The texture is soft and chewy on the inside 
            and nice and crispy on the outside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>25 g of white sugar</li>
            <li>2 g of salt</li>
            <li>450 g of milk</li>
            <li>5 g of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>120 g of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>130 g of glutinous rice flour (Mochiko)</li>
            <li>15 g of baking powder</li>
            <li>Any filling you like, such as red bean paste, cheese, pudding, Nutella, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Taiyaki waffle iron or pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until creamy in texture.</li>
            <li>Add salt, milk, and vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and baking powder and mix thoroughly. The batter should be slightly
                runnier than a pancake batter. If it is too thick, add a splash more milk.</li>
            <li>Heat up the taiyaki waffle iron or pan.</li>
            <li>Pour in just enough batter onto the bottom side to cover it.</li>
            <li>Add some filling in the centre of the taiyaki (do not over fill).</li>
            <li>Pour in more batter over the filling then close the waffle iron or pan.</li>
            <li>Cook each side for approximately 70-90 seconds. Time may vary due to different waffle 
                irons or stoves. Check if ready by opening the iron or pan.</li>
            <li>Take out the cooked taiyaki and cool on a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Repeat the above steps until the batter runs out.</li>
        </ol>
